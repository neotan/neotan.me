## Scenario

When you specify vertical properties (e.g. padding/margin-top and
padding/margin-bottom) to a box is container in its parent box as below:

While you are resizing the **width** of browser window, you will see the height
of yellow box is changing.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title></title>
    <style>
      .container {
        width: 100%;
        height: 400px;
        background: red;
      }

      .inner {
        background-color: yellow;
        width: 300px;
        height: 200px;
        padding-top: 10%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="container">
      .container 100% * 400
      <div class="inner">.inner 300 * 200</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

You probably noticed that the inner's padding/margin-top and
padding/margin-bottom as a percentage will always related to its parent's
**width**, instead of parent's height, is it a bug of W3C? Actually, NO, refer
the W3C spec:

- [w3.org > 8.3 Margin properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#margin-properties)
- [w3.org > 8.4 Padding properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#padding-properties)

> Percentages: refer to **width** of containing block

## Why the W3C spec is written like this?

Unknown so far, but some points were raised by
[Ryan Kinal > w3c - Why are margin/padding percentages in CSS always calculated against width? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11004839)
are interesting and seems resonable.

> Element height is defined by the height of the children. If an element has
> padding-top: 10% (relative to parent height), that is going to affect the
> height of the parent. Since the height of the child is dependent on the height
> of the parent, and the height of the parent is dependent on the height of the
> child, we'll either have inaccurate height, or an infinite loop. Sure, this
> only affects the case where offset parent === parent, but still. It's an odd
> case that is difficult to resolve.
